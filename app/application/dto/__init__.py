"""Application Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).

This module contains request and response schemas used by the
application layer to transfer data between the interface and
domain layers.

DTOs are simple data containers with no business logic.
They are used to:
- Validate incoming request data
- Serialize outgoing response data
- Decouple the API layer from domain entities
